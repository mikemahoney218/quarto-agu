# Plain Language Summary {.unnumbered}

The Plain Language Summary should be written for a broad audience,
including journalists and the science-interested public, that will not have 
a background in your field.

A Plain Language Summary is required in GRL, JGR: Planets, JGR: Biogeosciences,
JGR: Oceans, G-Cubed, Reviews of Geophysics, and JAMES.
See http://sharingscience.agu.org/creating-plain-language-summary/

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This is an example of how to use this template to render journal articles. This template adapts the AGU LaTeX template and extends it for the Quarto publishing system.  

This quarto extension format supports PDF and HTML outputs. This template is primarily focused on generating acceptable {{< latex >}} outputs from Quarto, but renders an acceptable HTML output using the standard Quarto options.

# Format Instructions

You should set the `journalname` option in the YAML header to match the journal you intend to submit to. At time of writing, the full set of AGU journals is as follows:

+ JGR: Atmospheres
+ JGR: Biogeosciences
+ JGR: Earth Surface
+ JGR: Oceans
+ JGR: Planets
+ JGR: Solid Earth
+ JGR: Space Physics
+ Global Biogeochemical Cycles
+ Geophysical Research Letters
+ Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology
+ Radio Science
+ Reviews of Geophysics
+ Tectonics
+ Space Weather
+ Water Resources Research
+ Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems
+ Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)
+ Earth's Future
+ Earth and Space Science
+ Geohealth

The AGU LaTeX template provides the following instructions:

A title should be specific, informative, and brief. Use abbreviations only if they are defined in the abstract. Titles that start with general keywords then specific terms are optimized in searches.

The main text should start with an introduction. Except for short
manuscripts (such as comments and replies), the text should be divided
into sections, each with its own heading.

Headings should be sentence fragments and do not begin with a
lowercase letter or number.

## Section Heads

Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
three or fewer letters).

AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.

## In-Text Lists

Do not use bulleted lists; enumerated lists are okay.

## Equations

Single-line equations are centered.
Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode (\$...\$)
 will not be numbered, e.g.,: $x^2=y^2 + z^2$

Math coded inside \\begin{equation} and \\end{equation} will
be automatically numbered, e.g.,:

\begin{equation}
x^2=y^2 + z^2
\end{equation}

To create multiline equations, use the
\\begin{eqnarray} and \\end{eqnarray} environment
as demonstrated below.

\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:

\\begin{eqnarray\*}...\\end{eqnarray\*}

Break each line at a sign of operation
(+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
on the new line.

Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
the first character following the equal sign on the
first line.

Use an \\hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
\\hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
the correct amount of space.


## Equation Numbering: Counter

You may change equation numbering by resetting
the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
an equation.

To explicitly number an equation, type \\eqnum{}
(with the desired number between the brackets)
after the \\begin{equation} or \\begin{eqnarray}
command.  The \\eqnum{} command will affect only
the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
any equations appearing later in the manuscript
according to the equation counter.

If you have a multiline equation that needs only
one equation number, use a \\nonumber command in
front of the double backslashes as shown in
the multiline equation above.

If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
equations with \\begin{linenomath\*}...\\end{linenomath\*}

 To add line numbers to lines in equations:  
 \\begin{linenomath\*}  
 \\begin{equation}  
 \\end{equation}  
 \\end{linenomath\*}

# Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

# Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed the outputs of code by including code blocks in the document; for instance, below (in the `.qmd` file) you can see the code that generated @tbl-glm.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-glm
#| tbl-cap: "A table."

# install.packages("broom")
# install.packages("kableExtra")
data("quine", package = "MASS")
m_pois <- glm(Days ~ (Eth + Sex + Age + Lrn)^2, data = quine, family = poisson)
kableExtra::kable_styling(
  kableExtra::kbl(broom::tidy(m_pois))
)
```

Note that this format does not support displaying blocks of code in PDF.

# Markdown Basics

This section of the template is adapted from [Quarto's documentation on Markdown basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

## Text Formatting

+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Markdown Syntax                   | Output                        |
+===================================+===============================+
|     *italics* and **bold**        | *italics* and **bold**        |

+---------------------+-----------------------------------+
|     ### Header 3    | ### Header 3 {.heading-output}    |
+---------------------+-----------------------------------+

## Equations

Use `$` delimiters for inline math and `$$` delimiters for display math. For example:

+-------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Markdown Syntax               | Output                  |
+===============================+=========================+
|     inline math: $E = mc^{2}$ | inline math: $E=mc^{2}$ |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------+
|     display math:             | display math:\          |
|                               | $$E = mc^{2}$$          |
|     $$E = mc^{2}$$            |                         |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------+

If assigned an ID, display math equations will be automatically numbered:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathrm C}{ \partial \mathrm t } + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} \mathrm S^{2}
\frac{\partial^{2} \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm C^2}
  + \mathrm r \mathrm S \frac{\partial \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S}\ =
  \mathrm r \mathrm C 
$$ {#eq-black-scholes}
